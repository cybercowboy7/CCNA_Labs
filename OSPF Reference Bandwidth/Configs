1. Configure the appropriate hostnames and IP addresses on each device.  Enable router interfaces.
    (You don't have to configure ISPR1)

### Self-Explanatory ###


2. Configure a loopback interface on each router (1.1.1.1/32 for R1, 2.2.2.2/32 for R2, etc.)

### Self-Explanatory ###



3. Enable OSPF directly on each interface of the routers.
    Configure passive interfaces as appropriate.

R1(config)#router ospf 1
R1(config-router)#passive-interface default
R1(config-router)#no passive-interface f1/0
R1(config-router)#no passive-interface g0/0

R1(config)# int f1/0
R1(config-if)# ip ospf 1 area 0
R1(config-if)# int g0/0
R1(config-if)# ip ospf 1 area 0

### Repeat for all other routers ###



4. Configure the reference bandwidth on each router so a FastEthernet interface
    has a cost of 100.

R1(config-router)# auto-cost reference-bandwidth 10000
R1# show ip route ospf

### Repeat for all routers###



5. Configure R1 as an ASBR that advertises a default route in to the OSPF domain.

R1(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2
R1(config)#router ospf 1
R1(config-router)#default-information originate




6. Check the routing tables of R4.  What default route(s) were added?
    (watch the video for a brief explanation)

R4# show ip route

### this shows that there is only one route via R2.




7. Use Simulation mode to view the OSPF Hello messages being sent by the routers.
    What fields are included in the Hello message?

### Source IP address of the advertised network, Destination multicast IP address ###
