1. Configure a default route to the Internet on R1.

R1(config)# ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2



2. Configure PC1, PC2, and PC3 to use 1.1.1.1 as their DNS server.

### Self-explanatory ###




3. Configure R1 to use 1.1.1.1 as its DNS server.
    Configure host entries on R1 for R1, PC1, PC2, and PC3.
    Ping PC1 by name from R1.

R1(config)#ip name-server 1.1.1.1
R1(config)#ip host R1 192.168.0.254
R1(config)#ip host PC1 192.168.0.1
R1(config)#ip host PC1 192.168.0.2
R1(config)#ip host PC1 192.168.0.3





4. #USE SIMULATION MODE FOR THIS STEP#
    From PC1, ping youtube.com by name.  Analyze the messages being sent.

### When you ping youtube.com by hostname from PC1, you can see the process of how the DNS request goes to the DNS server, which sends a DNS reply back to PC1 telling it the IP of youtube.com.
The ICMP traffic is then sent to youtube.com ###
