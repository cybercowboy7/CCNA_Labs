The network has been pre-configured (IP addresses, OSPF)

1. The connection between R1 and R2 has been newly added.
  -Configure the serial connection between R1 and R2 (clock rate of 128000).
  -Configure OSPF on R1 and R2.

R1#config t
R1(config)# int s0/0/0
R1(config-if)# clock rate 128000

R1(config)# int s0/0/0
R1(config-if)#ip ospf 1 area 0
R1(config-if)#ip ospf network point-to-point 

### I also configured IP addresses for the serial interfaces because it seems there was no IP addresses for those interfaces causing the links to be down ###


2. Only R3 has a route to 10.0.2.0/24.  Why?  Fix the problem.

R3(config)#int g0/1
R3(config-if)#no ip ospf network point-to-point

### Router 3 G0/1 interface was in point-to-point network mode. disabled ###


3. R2 and R4 won't become OSPF neighbors with R5.  Why?  Fix the problem.

First, I checked all interfaces in the same subnet on Routers 2 and 4.
R2#show ip ospf int g0/0

### It shows that the Hello timer and dead timer are 10 and 40 while router 5 is set to 5 and 20 ###
### changed it on router 5 to match ###

R5(config)#int g0/0
R5(config-if)#ip ospf hello-interval 10
R5(config-if)#ip ospf dead-interval 40


4. PC1 and PC2 can't ping the external server 8.8.8.8.  Why?  Fix the problem.

Router 5 did was not advertising its default route to the ISP router.

R5(config)#ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2 
R5(config)#router ospf 1
R5(config-router)#default-information originate



5. Examine the LSDB.  What LSAs are present?

R1# show ip ospf database
