!! Which switch is the root bridge? What appears different than what you have learned about the root bridge? What is the cause of this? !!

SW1# show spanning-tree

### The output shows that SW1 is the root bridge ###
### It seems that there is a blocking port on the root bridge which is different then all designated ports on the root bridge ###
### The cause of this must be the Hub attached between SW1 and SW3. There is only a need for 1 designated port per collision domain. ###

!! Determine the port role/state of each remaining switch interface !!

SW2:
  - F0/1: R
  - G0/1: Alt/Discarding
  - F0/2: D

SW3:
  - F0/2: R
  - G0/1: D
  - F0/1: D

SW4:
  - F0/2: Alt/Discarding
  - F0/1: R



!! Manually configure the appropriate RSTP link type on each interface. What do you think is the correct link type for SW1s F0/24? !!

SW1(config) int f0/24
SW1(config-if) spanning-tree link-type shared
SW1(config-if) int f0/1
SW1(config-if) spanning-tree link-type point-to-point
SW1(config-if) int f0/2
SW1(config-if) spanning-tree link-type shared
SW1(config-if) int f0/3
SW1(config-if) spanning-tree link-type shared

### Do the rest of the switches in the same fashion as the first switch. ###
