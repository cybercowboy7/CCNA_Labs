Network 192.168.5.0/24 :: Utilizing VLSM

LAN 1: Requires 45 Hosts

LAN 2: Requires 64 Hosts

LAN 3: Requires 14 Hosts

LAN 4: Requires 9 Hosts

!! LAN 2 requires the mosts hosts, so we must assign the largest subnet the beginning of the address space !!

LAN 2 Subnet:

Network Address: 192.168.5.0/25
Broadcast Address: 192.168.5.127/25
Usable Addresses: 192.168.5.1 - 192.168.5.126

!! LAN 1 requires the most hosts next, so we must assign the next addresses in the space to this subnet !!

LAN 1 Subnet:

Network Address: 192.168.5.128/26
Broadcast Address: 192.168.5.191/26
Usable Addresses: 192.168.5.129 - 192.168.5.190

!! LAN 3 requires the most hosts next, so we must assign the next addresses in the space to this subnet !!

LAN 3 Subnet:

Network Address: 192.168.5.192/28
Broadcast Address: 192.168.5.207/28
Usable Addresses: 192.168.5.193 - 192.168.5.206

!! LAN 4 is our smallest subnet so it will go last (As far as the LANs are concerned)!!

LAN 4 Subnet:

Network Address: 192.168.5.208/28
Broadcast Address: 192.168.5.223/28
Usable Addresses: 192.168.5.209 - 192.168.5.222

!! Our Final Addresses will be the Point to Point link between R1 and R2 !!

Network Address: 192.168.5.224/30
Broadcast Address: 192.168.5.227/30
Usable Addresses: 192.168.5.225 - 192.168.5.226


!! Once All LANs are subnetted, configure the PCs in each subnet with the first usable IP and the Router interface in that LAN with the last usable IP !!
!! Once complete, add static routes on R1 and R2 to ensure all PCs in each LAN can communicate with one another !!
