Interfaces are enabled and configured with IPv4.
You will configure IPv6 in the network.



1. Use EUI-64 to configure IPv6 addresses on G0/1 of R1/R2
   *Before configuring the addresses, calculate the EUI-64 interface ID that will be 
     generated on each interface.

ipv6 unicast-routing
int g0/1
ipv6 address 2001:db8::/64 eui-64

SAME ON R2



  

2. Configure the appropriate IPv6 addresses/default gateways on PC1 and PC2.

SELF EXPLANATORY


  

3. Enable IPv6 on G0/0 of R1/R2 without explicitly configuring an IPv6 address.

ipv6 enable

(do this on g0/0 for both R1 and R2)

  

4. Configure static routes on R1/R2 to enable PC1 to ping PC2.
    Use the 'ipv6 route' command with '?' to learn how to use the command.
   *We will study IPv6 static routes in depth in Day 33.

ipv6 route 2001:db8:0:1::/64 g0/0 FE80::201:63FF:FE80:B801
