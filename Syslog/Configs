1. Connect to R1's console port using PC2:
     -Shut down the G0/0 interface
     -After you receive a syslog message, re-enable the interface.
     -What is the severity level of the syslog messages?
     -Enable timestamps for logging messages

R1(config)#int g0/0
R1(config-if)#shut

R1(config-if)#
%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface GigabitEthernet0/0, changed state to administratively down

%LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface GigabitEthernet0/0, changed state to down

R1(config-if)#no shut

R1(config-if)#
%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface GigabitEthernet0/0, changed state to up

%LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface GigabitEthernet0/0, changed state to up


### It looks as if the severity is level 5 meaning it is a 'notice' level ###

R1(config)#service timestamps log datetime msec 





2. Telnet from PC1 to R1's G0/0 interface (watch the video to learn how!)
     -Enable the unused G0/1 interface
     -Why does no syslog message appear?
     -Enable logging to the VTY lines for the current session.
  *there is no 'logging monitor' command in packet tracer, 
    but it's enabled by default


### This lab is not very accurate in packet tracer, skipping for now ###


  

3. Enable logging to the buffer, and configure the buffer size to 8192 bytes.

4. Enable logging to the syslog server SRV1 with a level of 'debugging'.
