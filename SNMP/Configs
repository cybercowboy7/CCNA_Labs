## SNMP functionality is VERY limited in Packet Tracer! ##

1. Configure the following SNMP communities on R1:
read-only: Cisco1
read/write: Cisco2

R1(config)#snmp-server community Cisco1 ro
R1(config)#snmp-server community Cisco2 rw




2. Use SNMP 'Get' messages via the MIB browser on PC1 to check the following:
-How long has R1 been running? (system uptime)
-What is the currently configured hostname on R1?
-How many interfaces does R1 have?
-What are those interfaces?

### For first question: go into PC1 MIB browser and fillout the IP of R1, select the appropriate MIB in the lefthand menu (system uptime), make sure it is a 
Get message, and hit go. You should see a system uptime of 10 hours and 5 minutes ###

### The configured hostname is R1 ###

### The router has 4 interfaces ###

### VLAN1, g0/0, g0/1, g0/2 ###

+check what other information you can learn about R1 via SNMP Get messages.
 
3. Use an SNMP 'Set' message from PC1 to change the hostname of R1.

### Changed the type of message to set, changed the DataType to a string since we are inputting characters for the new hostname. Hit send and verify in CLI of R1 ###
