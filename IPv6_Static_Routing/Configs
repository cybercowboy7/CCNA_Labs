IPv6 addresses have been pre-configured on the routers.
The serial connections use link-local addresses only.

1. Enable IPv6 routing on each router.

R1(config)#ipv6 unicast-routing 
### Repeat for all routers ###



2. Use SLAAC to configure IPv6 addresses on the PCs.
    What IPv6 address was configured on each PC?

R1(config)#int g0/0
R1(config-if)#ipv6 address autoconfig




3. Configure static routes on the routers to allow PC1 and PC2 to ping each other.
    The path via R2 should be used only as a backup path.

### Router 1 ### ### for the floating static route, utilize the link local IPv6 address on next hop ###
ipv6 route 2001:DB8:0:3::/64 2001:DB8:0:13::2
ipv6 route 2001:DB8:0:3::/64 Serial0/0/0 FE80::20B:BEFF:FED7:4901 150

### Complete the routes on all 3 routers ###
