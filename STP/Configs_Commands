!! Use the CLI to check the current STP topology. What is the current root bridge? What is the STP role/state of each port on each switch? !!

SW2# show spanning-tree detail

### From the output of this command, we see that SW2 is the root of the Spanning tree ###
### Roles/States of each port on each switch ###

  - SW2:
      F0/1: Designated Forwarding 
      F0/2: Designated Forwarding
      F0/3: Designated Forwarding
  - SW3:
      F0/1: Designated Forwarding
      F0/2: Root Forwarding
      F0/3: Designated Forwarding
  - SW4:
      F0/1: Root Forwarding
      F0/2: Alternate Blocking
      F0/3: Designated Forwarding
  - SW1:
      F0/1: Alternate Blocking
      F0/2: Designated Forwarding
      F0/3: Root Forwarding

!! Configure SW1 as the primary root for VLAN1 and the secondary root for VLAN2. !!
!! COnfigure SW2 and the primary root for VLAN2 and the secondary root for VLAN1.!!
!! What is the STP role/state of each port on each switch now? !!

SW1(config) spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary
SW1(config) spanning-tree vlan 2 root secondary

SW2(config) spanning-tree vlan 2 root primary
SW2(config) spanning-tree vlan 1 root secondary


  - SW2: 
      F0/1: Designated Forwarding (VLAN1), Designated Forwarding (VLAN2)
      F0/2: Designated Forwarding (VLAN1), Designated Forwarding (VLAN2)
      F0/3: Root Forwarding (VLAN1), Designated Forwarding (VLAN2)
  - SW3:
      F0/1: Root Forwarding (VLAN1), Alternate Blocking (VLAN2) 
      F0/2: Alternate Blocking (VLAN1), Root Forwarding (VLAN2)
      F0/3: Designated Forwarding (VLAN1), ------ (VLAN2)
  - SW4:
      F0/1: Alternate Blocking (VLAN1), Root Forwading (VLAN2)
      F0/2: Root Forwarding (VLAN1), Alternate Blocking (VLAN2) 
      F0/3: ------ (VLAN1), Designated Forwarding (VLAN2)
  - SW1:
      F0/1: Designated Forwarding (VLAN1), Designated Forwarding (VLAN2)
      F0/2: Designated Forwarding (VLAN1), Designated Forwarding (VLAN2)
      F0/3: Designated Forwarding (VLAN1), Root Forwarding (VLAN2)






!! Increase the VLAN1 cost of SW4s F0/2 interface to 100. Does SW4 select a different root port? !!

SW4(config-if) spanning-tree vlan 1 cost 100

### The switch selects interface f0/1 as the root port because it has a lower cost. ###





!! Increase the VLAN 1 port priority of SW1s F0/1 to 240. Does SW3 select a different root port? !!


SW1(config-if)# spanning-tree vlan 1 port-priority 240

### F0/1 still has a lower root cost then f0/2 so SW3 will not select a different root port. ###





!! Configure PortFast and BPDU guard on the F0/3 interfaces of SW3/SW4 !!

SW3(config-if)#spanning-tree portfast 
SW3(config-if)#spanning-tree bpduguard enable

same thing for SW4
