!! Check the routing tables of R1 and R2. Which dynamic routing protocol is Enterprise A using? Which route will be used if PC1 tries to access SRV1?
   Which route will be used if PC1 tries to access remote server 1.1.1.1 over the Internet? Test by pinging SRV1 and 1.1.1.1 !!

R1# show ip route 

### Based on the output, enterprise A is utilize OSPF as their dynamic routing protocol ###
### It will use the OSPF route to Router 2 and then to server 1 ###
### It will use the default static route ###


!! Configure floating static routes on R1 and R2 that allow PC1 to reach SRV1 if the link between R1 and R2 fails. Do the routes enter the routing tables of R1 and R2? !!

R1(config)# ip route 10.0.2.0 255.255.255.0 203.0.113.1 111

R2(config)# ip route 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0 203.0.113.5 111

### No, the routes do not enter the routing table since their admin distances are set greater than OSPF AD ###

!! Shut down the G0/2/0 interface of R1 or R2. Do the floating static routes enter the routing tables of R1 and R2? Ping from PC1 to SRV1 to confirm. !!

R1(config-if)# shut
R1(config-if)# do show ip route
